<b> Assignment 1: Human Activity Recognition using Sensor Data through KNNs</b>
Utilized the unsupervised version of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict human activity by analyzing time series data from three distinct sensors: gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer. Employed advanced techniques such as chunking and statistical feature descriptors for efficient feature extraction. Remarkably, achieved an accuracy of 55% solely through meticulous data preprocessing, without resorting to any supervised learning algorithms

<b> Assignment 2 : Audio Classification on Google Speech Command Dataset using Gaussian Mixture Models  </b>
Utilizing Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for audio representation as time series data, coupled with Fourier transforms, autocorrelations, and statistical moments as feature descriptors, comprehensive feature extraction for audio classification was conducted. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) were subsequently trained on the extracted features to assign accurate labels to diverse audio samples. Achieved an accuracy of 65% on this task
